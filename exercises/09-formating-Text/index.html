		<p>Then, you start talking about something interesting stuff that nobody wants to read</p>
		Then you can quote someone to add credibility

		<blockquote cite="-A.A Milne, If I MAY">
			A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble <br />of thinking for oneself, alwaysa laborious bussiness.
			<br />

			Finally you can have some bullets so everithing, after all, new <br />
			generations have this things in common:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ul>
